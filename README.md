WP-CLI command to replace NextGEN singlepic shortcode with native Wordpress images. 

# Installation
First install [WP-CLI](http://wp-cli.org/), then install the command: `wp package install git@github.com:slavicd/replace-ngg.git`

# Usage
`wp custom replace-ngg`
See `wp help custom replace-ngg` and code for more details.

# Contribute
This is just a quick and dirty implementation: I welcome pull requests that deal with [nggallery] shortcode too, in addition to [singlepic].
